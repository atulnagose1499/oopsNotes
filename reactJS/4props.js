// In React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are passed to a component as an object, and the component can access the data using this.props.

// prop types are a useful tool for ensuring that components are used correctly and that the data passed to them is valid. They can improve the overall quality of code and make it easier for developers to work with.

// default props are only used if the parent component does not pass a value for the prop in question. If the parent component does pass a value for the prop, that value will be used instead of the default value.

// React Developer Tools is a browser extension that allows developers to inspect and debug React components and their props and state. It allows developers to easily understand the structure of a React application, identify and fix bugs, improve performance, and make real-time code changes. It is available for popular web browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
